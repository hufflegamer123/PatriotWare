# individual_scripts/passwords.sh

passwords.sh should be ran like this: ./passwords.sh PutYourPasswordHere

and it will give every user the password entered into the PutYourPasswordHere position. While this isn't secure for a real life setting, it is enough for CyberPatriot. I will later add the option to make all users be required to change their password on next logon.
