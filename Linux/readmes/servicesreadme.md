Just make sure you have all the files, especially the data_files/servicesWhitelist.txt file. In the future I will add the ability to specify your own whitelist. If you would like another service added to the data_files/servicesWhitelist.txt file, contact me at hufflegamer123 on github so I can take a look at it.
