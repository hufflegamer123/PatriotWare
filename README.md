# PatriotWare

A collection of scripts made for the CyberPatriot competition.

# Before You Begin:

1. It is against CyberPatriot rules to use someone elses scripts. You can mess around with these in your own VMs, and take inspiration from them, but you can't use them in competition.
2. All of the scripts in the Linux directory are written in bash, which is for Linux. These scripts will only work on Linux, and have only been tested on debian based systems. The apt.sh script was designed for only Debian and Ubuntu, but can be modified to work with any pre configured apt directory.
3. Guess what, all of the scripts in the Windows directory are for- *Steve Harvey enters* "Top five answers on the board!" SHUT UP STEVE HARVEY, THERE IS ONLY ONE ANSWER. Sorry you had to read that, I think I'm funny. They are for Windows, and they are written in PowerShell. They are also currently very basic and experimental, so use at your own risk.
3. If you find a bug, or want to ask me anything about these scripts, you can contact me on my GitHub account, https://github.com/hufflegamer123/.

# How to Use:

You should read the readme.md file for each script before using it. Many of the scripts have files that require your user input. You can print out the readme of each file by running the script with -h (Currently only a Linux feature. This might be the only thing with more features on Linux than Windows). You should run scripts from either the Windows or Linux directory respectively. Also, if you are reading this, you are in the matrix. Wait for further instructions by waking up to your UNIX terminal to start talking to you.
