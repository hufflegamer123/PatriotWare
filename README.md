# PatriotWare

A collection of scripts made for the CyberPatriot competition.

# Before You Begin:

1. It is against CyberPatriot rules to use someone elses scripts. You can mess around with these in your own VMs, and take inspiration from them, but you can't use them in competition.
2. All of these scripts are written in bash, which for Linux. These scripts will only work on Linux, and have only been tested on debian based systems. The apt.sh script was designed for only Debian and Ubuntu, but can be modified to work with any pre configured apt directory.
3. If you find a bug, or want to ask me anything about these scripts, you can contact me on my GitHub account, https://github.com/hufflegamer123/.

# How to Use:

You should read the readme.md file for each script before using it. Many of the scripts have files that require your user input. You can print out the readme of each file by running the script with -h. Make sure to only run scripts from the GMFL_Improved directory.
