# individual_scripts/group.sh

group.sh is an optional script that easily creates a group and
adds users to it. This script is kind of a bodge, but it was
really just a quick grab at easy script points for the Debian 10 
practice round image.

Call the script like so:

sudo ./individual_scripts/group.sh groupName user1 user2 user3 etc...
